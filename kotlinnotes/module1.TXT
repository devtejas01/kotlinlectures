kotlin is a mordern language which is used to create android apps
variable are of two type 
1st (var) mutable means the value can be change val is that type of variable
2nd (val) inmutable means the value cant be changed so we var is that type of variable whose value cant be changed
kotlin automaticaly understand what type of data are we going to store in the variable
but if we want to define the variable explicatly we use var/val kaku:String=kaku

//simple kotlin code
fun main()
{
println("enter your name")
val name=readln()
println("your name is $name")
}
//output 
enter your name
tejaswee
your name is tejaswee

questions 
q1)Kotlin mein immutable variable kaunsa keyword se banta hai?
val use krke inmutable variables bana skte hain
q2)Ye code kya print karega?
val x = 5
val y = 10
println(x + y)

//output
15
ðŸ“± App Idea (Mini App):
You can create a simple app that asks user's name and age and shows a greeting like:
code of the app goes like
fun main()
{
    println("enter your name")
    val name =readln()
    println("enter your age")
    var age =readln()
    println("your name is : $name")
    println("your age is : $age")

}
